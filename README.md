## Overview##
This repository was created for the Programming and Scripting module of the ATU Mayo Galway 'Higher Diploma in Computer Programming and Data Analytics' course. It was created to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Fisher's Iris data set. It contains an evidence of the research of the data set, a Python code and a writen documentation, including descriptions of the research and the code and references to the materials used during the process of creating them. 

## Fisher's Iris Data Set ##
The Fisher's Iris data set is a classic data set in which is commonly used for data analysis and pattern recognition tasks. It was first introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936. The data set consists of 150 observations of iris flowers, with four variables measured for each flower: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The observations are divided equally into three species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. 


## The Code ##

The code performs a basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Fisher's Iris data set.
Outputs a summary of each variable (i.e., each column in the data set) to a text file using the **describe()** method of a Pandas DataFrame.
Saves a histogram of each variable to a PNG file using the **hist()** method of Matplotlib.
Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables using the **scatter()** method of Matplotlib.
Overall, the goal of this code is to provide a basic overview of the data set and to help identify any patterns or relationships between the variables.
